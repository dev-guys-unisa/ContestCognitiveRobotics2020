# Utils folder

This folder includes some utils for the project realization and documentation.
All the support scripts used during the implementation are contained in the ```script``` folder.

* The ```wakeup.py``` script is responsible to connect to pepper and let him wake up from a standby position.
* The ```noobsetup.sh``` is a bash script to make the easiest setup possible to run the demo.
