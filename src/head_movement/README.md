# Head_Movement package for Pepper
This package is all about making pepper move its head left and right while looking in multiple directions.

The node ```head_shake``` lets Pepper turn his head first to the left side and then to the right side. At the end it will look in the starting position, setted to ```[0.1, 0.0]```
